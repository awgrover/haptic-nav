Some Goals.
The goal is a navigation device that becomes an unconcious sixth-sense, so a user can navigate as if naturally, as if already knowing their way around. This unconcious sense has apparently worked for artificial-horizons and absolute-north.

I imagine a haptic-device that gives a sense of:
* Absolute north, for a sense of orientation. Thus, you wouldn't get turned around.
* Bearing towards home, which I imagine is a distince sense from just orientation. And I imagine is useful. This is a question to investigate. Can we include a sense of distance, perhaps using a "stereo" behavior?
* Perhaps bearings to several points (work? favorite coffee shop)? How many are feasible? How to encode the haptic sense? Would this give a triangulation sense?
* Way finding while biking:
	* A sense of how "good" each direction is at an intersection. I imagine that this will give a sense of options, and opportunity to explore alternate routes based on immediate preferences & situations. For example, I prefer to avoid the main roads in Amsterdam, and bike through the "side" streets. What do I mean by "good"? Some predefine preferences like traffic-speed, or bike lane quality, or hilliness?
	* A sense of "directness". So that a direct street ("straight") would feel different from a winding/round-about way. This seems to overlap with the above. I imagine a feeling of openness associated with a (relative) direction: to the right (where there is a street) it feels dull and solid, but left feels open and clear. How to signal this? Especially when there are 3 (or more) possible alternatives? Can a "stereo" like sense be part of this to give a distance feel? I imagine being able to feel that there is an obstacle, like a river (with limited bridges). I imagine being able to feel a sense of "fast" one way, and "slow" the other. I imagine being able to feel whether there are lots of alternatives along one way, or perhaps very restrictive alternatives along the other. How to encode various dimensions?
	* A sense of distance to the destination.
	* A sense of the where the route is going next. Like a leading sound or light up ahead. I imagine feeling a pull forward and to the right as the road curves, for example.
For all these indications/signals, the goal is for the indication to become a integrated sense, rather than a concious signal. Cf. haptic-artifical-horizons. So, the encoding of the indications will probably take a lot of trial. I imagine sense of "bigness", forward, pulling back or to the side.
	* I imagine feeling several "turns" ahead, rather than just one, in some way feeling the route. Similar to seeing the path on a map.
* Where your friends are. Direction and distance. Can we convert that to routing? Can it become a sense? How many friends? What if they are together? How do you broadcast?
* I imagine an overlay for Home (or other "bearings"): while you should know the absolute, there shoul be a way-finding for it, so you always know how to navigate home. "That street over there..."
* I imagine that the way-finding changes based on your transportation mode. If you are walking, and it's a long ways, take public transit.... Bikes have a longer threshold.

Research Questions etc.
	Play with piezo...
	What dimensions can we use to encode indications?
		* Volume
		* Frequency
		* taps, pulses
		* phantom pressure
		* patterns moving between transducers (waves, "drag", ???)
		* "stereo" like (widely separated transducers)
		* lateral vs. transverse actuation (piezo-film?)
		* heterodyning?
		* "natural sounds" as contrasted to pure frequencies.
		* sets of frequencies. different volumes of each? a composable language?
	What leads to integrating the transducer as an unconcious sense?
		* I assume constant signals become "background"
		* "Similar" signals for ranges? Like deviation from north are all the same frequency (and perhaps spatially indicative). Or, a pure square wave along a range of frequencies to indicated direction? Or? 
		* spatial linear, spatially circular, concentric rings, cross,
		* psuedo pressure (assymetric sawtooth?)
		* Earlobe clips for stereo? (not audible)
		* location on the body. Right wrist, left ankle, waist, back...
		* Build it into a cap? The headband is one dimension. etc.
	Does the feeling of alternative routes help defuse the abdication of responsibility that leads people to follow their GPS into a lake? If you can feel the possibility of other directions, will you be more willing to evaluate the "main" path and go around some dubious path?
	Does the user develop a sense of way finding that is more anticipatory then just one-turn-ahead?
	Can you develop a useful position sense from triangulation? What kind of sense?
	
	Technology
		I assume the "north" on the n-axis/gps sensors are stable & accurate enough.
		How fast does the GPS need to update for the various "senses"?
		How much of this can I do with OSRM?
		What senses can be done "offline"?
			Should we load a corridor of "re-routing"? For when you make a wrong turn?
		What actually happens when someone is going somewhere? Do they stick to the route? Do they make detours? How do you resume?
		Can we interface with cheap smart phones (android) to provide the remote-routing calculations? What is the real-timey'ness?
		How much memory do routes & other info take? Sounds?
		Do we need external storage (SD, etc.)? Is it fast enough?
		
1.0
* Abs North
* Bearing Home. Distance?
* piezo disks (piezo-film if I can get it).
* arduino + lipo

Stories.
	Never get turned around, by having a sixth sense of North. The haptic indication should become subconcious, so it requires no attention, but just becomes a "sense."
		A compass for the north data, should be hooked up to the arduino. I should have brought/got a neo-pixel ring for development and debugging to see the output.

			For portable use, a long enough lasting battery (lipo setup). Will need some kind of carrier (bag?)? Do I have the wire and connectors to do this?
			Build that feature without filtering/averaging, so we can Collect data about the questions. How can we collect data nicely? Use the static space? So, also add a button.
			And, then, in that case, use the GPS to grab a lat/long for logging.
				How much noise? Do we have to "average"?
				How stable?
				How do buildings and bridges affect it?
				How does being inside affect it?
				Is it fast enough when turning, does it catch up fast enough to avoid confusion? Can the behavior make "lag" ok?
				Should a gyro be used with it as a check on turning to filter out "iron"?
				How long does it take for the indication to drop below concious?
			End up with a reliable North signal that can be used for a haptic-indication.
		A haptic indicator for North, or rather, for absolute direction.
			Research extant/prior haptic indicators (e.g. artificial horizon & abs north).
			Experiment with the piezo's.
			Design & build a protoype indicator for use for North.
			Try it out, share it, document how it works and ideas for improving it.
			End up with a haptic indicator that holds together well enough, and is robust enough for day-long trials, and which seems likely to give the "sense".
			Try to use it enough to develop the "sense".
		Bearing to Home. Add a 2nd sense of the bearing to home.

				How are we doing with compute time? Add a "load" indicator....
				The neo-ring would be useful here again!
				What is the resolution, accuracy, repeatability?
				Set several locations, in the open, in alleys, etc. Document the situations Again, using the "logging" feature.

I would like that "posted".

Gyro Feature.
This feature is inspired by sailing with a blind person. They have a very difficult time detecting slow turns (drifing off course) on the water. The absolute-north might help, but it needs to indicate small deviations with a constant rate of slow turning. So, it must magnify the sense of "turning" for small angular speeds. This seems like an extra sense.

Windex Feature?
On the one hand, it is desirable to hold a course which is the gyro/direction-feature. On the other hand, it is very often desirable to hold a tack. Holding a tack may be amenable to only feeling the wind, which is a sense and skill that new sailors are typically poor at. To gain experience with sensing the wind direction, new sailors check with windex (wind-vane) and tell-tales. In light wind, even experience sailors check the windex/tell-tales. So, how can a blind person check the tell-tales/windex (without instrumenting them)?

Also, if the wind is strong enough, it seems that a blind person can learn the sound-clues of a poorly trimmed sail (luffing), in combination with the heel/etc. of the boat to gauge trim/tack. These senses don't seem to need technological assist.

Interestingly, the blind person I sailed with was able to do quite accurate and consistent 90 degree turns. So, I assume large/fast angular changes are easy to detect. Though, perhaps long turns, 180, or 270/360 may be harder as the ear's systems accomodate to a turn rate, etc.
